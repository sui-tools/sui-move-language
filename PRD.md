# Technical Specification Document

## Project: Move Language Support for JetBrains IDEs

---

### 1. Overview

The goal is to build a robust JetBrains IDE plugin providing full support for the Move programming language, enabling improved developer productivity on the Sui blockchain.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Core Features

* **Syntax Highlighting:** Clearly identify Move syntax elements (keywords, functions, data types, variables).
* **Code Autocompletion:** Intelligent context-based completion for Move code.
* **Real-time Error Detection:** Inline validation of syntax and semantic errors.
* **Navigation and Refactoring:** Enable quick navigation between code elements and refactoring capabilities.
* **Integration with Move Tools:** Integrate seamlessly with Move compilers, analyzers, and testing frameworks.

#### 2.2 Advanced Features (Optional)

* **Debugger Integration:** Support debugging of Move smart contracts directly from the IDE.
* **Performance Analysis:** Integrated profiling and optimization tools.

### 3. Technical Architecture

#### 3.1 Plugin Structure

* **Lexer and Parser:** Implement language-specific syntax parsing.
* **Semantic Analysis Module:** Real-time semantic checking.
* **UI Integration Module:** Interface with JetBrainsâ€™ built-in editor and features.
* **Compiler and Tooling Integration:** Connect with external Move compilers and analyzers.

#### 3.2 Development Stack

* IntelliJ Platform SDK
* Kotlin for plugin implementation (Java as an alternative)
* Existing open-source Move tooling and libraries
